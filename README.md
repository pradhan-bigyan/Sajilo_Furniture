# Sajilo Furniture 🪑🛋️

**Sajilo Furniture** is a group semester project developed during our **3rd Year, 2nd Semester**.  
It is an e-commerce web platform designed to make furniture shopping easier and more accessible for users across Nepal.  

The main goal of this project is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for both **buyers** and **sellers**, offering features like:
- Responsive design for all devices  
- Secure payment integration (Khalti API)  
- Clear product categorization and search functionality  
- Seller dashboard for managing listings and orders  

This project was built following Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to ensure usability, simplicity, and aesthetic appeal.  
It represents our team’s effort to combine design, functionality, and technology into a practical real-world web solution.
